This is the code repository for Landscape to host agent API, referencing the protobuf and gRPC contracts between the landscape server and host agent.

This API allows to communicates actions from Landscape to subsystems installed on a given host. You can think of VMs, containers, WSL instancesâ€¦ Landscape server will instruct the host agent daemon on which machines he needs up and down.

This repository can generate Go and Python stubs from the protobuf ([`hostagent.proto`](./hostagent.proto)). Landscape pulls and generates the stubs itself, but you can use [`generate.sh`](./generate.sh) to generate the stubs locally.

Install requirements:

```sh
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler protoc-gen-go-grpc pipx
pipx install grpcio-tools
pipx ensurepath
```

Then, generate the stubs: 

```sh
sudo chmod +x generate.sh
./generate.sh
```
